/// SourceStarshipModel specializes SourceItem for tracking how and where starship
/// designs and classes appear in different sources. Unlike SourceStarship which
/// tracks individual vessels, this tracks general ship types such as:
/// - Fighter classes (X-wing, TIE Fighter designs)
/// - Freighter models (YT series Corellian designs)
/// - Capital ship classes (Imperial Star Destroyer types)
/// - Transport designs (Lambda-class shuttles)
