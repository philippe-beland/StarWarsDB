/// in different sources. This covers worlds across the galaxy, from the Core Worlds
/// to the Outer Rim. Planets can appear in various ways:
/// - As primary settings for the action
/// - In space travel sequences
/// - Through mentions in dialogue about trade routes or political affiliations
/// - In strategic discussions about military operations
