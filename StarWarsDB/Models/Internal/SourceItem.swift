import Foundation

/// Base class for tracking entity appearances in Star Wars media sources
///
/// SourceItem creates relationships between entities (characters, creatures, etc.)
/// and the sources they appear in, along with the type of appearance (present,
/// mentioned, flashback, etc.). This enables tracking how and where different
/// elements of the Star Wars universe are referenced.
///
/// This class serves as the foundation for specialized source tracking classes:
/// - SourceCharacter: For individual characters
/// - SourceCreature: For non-humanoid life forms
/// - SourceDroid: For artificial beings
/// - SourceOrganization: For groups and institutions
/// - SourcePlanet: For worlds and locations
/// - SourceSpecies: For sentient races
/// - SourceStarship: For individual vessels
/// - SourceStarshipModel: For vessel classes
/// - SourceVaria: For miscellaneous items and concepts
/// - SourceArtist/SourceAuthor: For content creators
class SourceItem: DataNode, Equatable, Identifiable {
    /// Unique identifier for the source-entity relationship
    var id: UUID
    
    /// The source material where the entity appears
    ///
    /// This can be any type of Star Wars media:
    /// - Movies and TV shows
    /// - Books and comics
    /// - Video games
    /// - Other official content
    var source: Source
    
    /// The entity that appears in the source

    /// This is a generic reference to any trackable element in the Star Wars
    /// universe. Subclasses specialize this for specific entity types like
    /// characters, planets, etc.
    var entity: Entity
    
    /// How the entity appears in the source
    ///
    /// This can be:
    /// - present: The entity is physically present
    /// - mentioned: The entity is verbally referenced
    /// - flashback: The entity appears in a past scene
    /// - vision: The entity appears in a Force vision
    /// - image: The entity is shown in a picture or hologram
    /// - indirectMentioned: The entity is alluded to without direct reference

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - id: Unique identifier
    ///   - source: The source material
    ///   - entity: The appearing entity
    ///   - appearance: How the entity appears
    ///   - recordType: Type of record for database
