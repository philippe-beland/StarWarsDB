Although it was always the plan to have a huge ship under water, the plan was to reveal this at the very end of the season.

It was designed specifically for this episode. The ship takes visual cues, such as double pods, from the original Imperial TIE Bomber. It differs from its Imperial cousin, however, in wing configuration. The original TIE Bomber had wings similar the the TIE Advanced, but the Interceptor-inspired wings give the FIrst Order TIE Bomber a more aggressive feel. The wing angles are also reversed. Both of theses changes helped the bomber to have a more unique silhouette from the front and the top, to distinguish it from the other TIE ships.",

Poe's meeting and overall interaction with the scavenger Naka Iit also consists of a different set of dialogue in the comic as compared to the novelization. Furthermore, in the novelization, Poe stays silent during the ride to Blowback Town until the moment he and Naka Iit are attacked by the Strus Clan, whereas in the comic he regales Naka Iit with tales of his adventures in the Resistance until they are interrupted by the Strus Clan's attack.

The group traveled for months before finding a spot that worked for them. But the trip was so long and supplies were so low that a lot of the tribe got sick. With very little food left, the older members convinced the head of the pack to go back to their original homeland and return with food and other necessities. And so he did. He left behind thirty males, seventeen females, and nine children, including his wife and daughter, and promised to return the following harvest with more people and supplies. A whole season passed before he could return, but when he did, he found the settlement empty. No signs of anyone. His wife, his daughter, the entire tribe... gone.",
