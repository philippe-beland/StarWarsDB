Although it was always the plan to have a huge ship under water, the plan was to reveal this at the very end of the season. There a a few clues throughout the season: In some of the first episodes, you see some lights that might be a reflection under the water. Then, in later episodes, you actually see the top part of the structure just under the water, to start to imply that there is more ship. Even though it was planned all along, the final design of this section of the Colossus wasn't completed until the final episode.",

Second, because Doza's tower would still act as the bridge of the ship, it kept the characters and set upright in space. This gave it a similar feel to Skystrike Academy from Star Wars REbels, so to help distinguish the two bases, more emphasis was put on breaking up the silhouettes and shapes of the Colossus, and repeating the angles, panels, and details that Bill George put into the top section.",

For one, it depicts Poe Dameron as being knocked unconscious during the TIE fighter's descent to Jakku which forces Finn to manually deploy his own ejector seat, whereas the comic instead shows Dameron triggering Finn's ejector seat to save Finn while Dameron then stays fully conscious throughout the rest of the fall until he is torn free from the cockpit. Poe's meeting and overall interaction with the scavenger Naka Iit also consists of a different set of dialogue in the comic as compared to the novelization. Furthermore, in the novelization, Poe stays silent during the ride to Blowback Town until the moment he and Naka Iit are attacked by the Strus Clan, whereas in the comic he regales Naka Iit with tales of his adventures in the Resistance until they are interrupted by the Strus Clan's attack.

The group traveled for months before finding a spot that worked for them. But the trip was so long and supplies were so low that a lot of the tribe got sick.

He left behind thirty males, seventeen females, and nine children, including his wife and daughter, and promised to return the following harvest with more people and supplies. A whole season passed before he could return, but when he did, he found the settlement empty. No signs of anyone. His wife, his daughter, the entire tribe... gone.",
